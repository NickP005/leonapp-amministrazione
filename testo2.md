DAVID 






TOMBA GIULIO II

https://ilreporter.it/sezioni/cronaca-e-politica/david-michelangelo-firenze-rimuovere-statua-petizione/


La figura nuda del David si erge su un basamento marmoreo di forma irregolare.

La posizione del corpo, come da tradizione classica, è chiastica: il braccio sinistro è piegato verso la spalla, sulla quale il David poggia la fionda e corrisponde alla gamba destra in tensione, sorretta dal puntello, sulla quale esso poggia l’intero peso del corpo.

Il braccio destro è rilassato nonostante la tensione della mano che regge il sasso. La gamba sinistra, rilassata, sporge leggermente verso l’esterno, poggiando il piede sul limite estremo del basamento; il tallone è sollevato ad indicare che si sta preparando al movimento.

La testa è volta verso sinistra e il viso mostra un’espressione corrucciata a sottolineare la tensione che precede la battaglia.

Michelangelo, infatti, coglie David nel momento che precede la lotta con Golia. Sono evidenti nelle membra e nelle vene a fior di pelle la tensione e la concentrazione che precedono l'azione.

La mano destra sproporzionata e i muscoli delle gambe sono espedienti per sottolineare la tensione fisica che corrisponde a quella psicologica. È evidente il riferimento al Doriforo di Policleto, rappresentato mentre si prepara alla gara.

Michelangelo was born in village of Caprese in 1475. By the time that Leonardo returns in Florence in 1500, Michelangelo was already a great competitor. He expressed a loyalty to the Florentine Republic  and produced art that represented the Republic’s challenge in front of history. He dominated all the 16th century up to the point that was virtually impossible ignoring his or his influence of 75 years of artistic production.
Michelangelo believed, was a florentine and was obsessed by guilt. He represents the movement of the human body which is the mortal veil of divine intention.
His family was a family of stonecutters.
He believes that more a painting approaches a sculpture, the better it is. The more a sculpture approaches a painting, the worse it is. The difference between them is as the difference of the sun and the moon. Sculpture must just be carving off the material. THe sculpture that is done by adding more material resembles the painting. In this was, he puts himself against Ghiberti and Donatello who based their works of bronze or marble on preliminary studies in clay or wax. It is like the creator in liberating the man from the matter.
Giorgio Vasari has been an assistant to Michelangelo. He goes in the study of Domenico del Ghirlandaio where he absorbs the traditions and techniques of the Quattrocento. Even 50 years later, in the Last Judment, the techniques learnt in the shop of Ghirlandaio where still evident when he used the Tuscan fresco. 
In the Brancacci chapel Pietro Torrigiani disfigured him for like breaking his nose.
Elegiac sweetness of the Madonna of the stairs.

The Taddei Tondo (1504-1505), a marble relief sculpture depicting the Holy Family, which was intended for a Florentine nobleman but was never completed by Michelangelo.
The Bruges Madonna (1504), a marble sculpture of the Madonna and Child commissioned by a Flemish guild, which was left unfinished after Michelangelo was called away to Rome.
The Capitoline Brutus (1564-1565), a marble bust of the Roman politician Lucius Junius Brutus, which Michelangelo worked on in his later years but left unfinished.
The Madonna and Child with the Lamb (1525-1530), a marble sculpture intended for the tomb of Pope Clement VII, which was left incomplete due to various complications.
The Two Slaves (1520-1534), a pair of marble sculptures that were intended to flank the tomb of Pope Julius II, but were left incomplete after the project was scaled back.



The David of Michelangelo was completed in 1504 from a coarse and weak block of marble

The David of Michelangelo is the ideal male. The veins, the eyes, the muscles. David is looking at the sublime.

Storia del David 
David was the second king of Israel during the first half of the 10th century BC. David is described in the Bible as a complex character, he is mainly important in three religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam.
The most famous biblical episode is that of the clash with Goliath, the Philistine giant who terrorized the Jews by challenging them to a duel. The Jews fought with the Philistines who had a giant named Goliath armed with heavy armor. For 40 days he challenged the Israeli army while waiting for the Jews to choose who among them had to face him: the victor would allow his people to subjugate the other. David was asked to bring food to his brothers who were at war and when he arrived at the camp he listened to one of Goliath's many duels and offered to face him. Saul dressed him in his own armor but after a few steps he took it off because it was too heavy and walked with his sling and 5 stones he had collected in a river. As soon as Goliath saw him, he mocked him but David took one of the stones he had with him and threw it at him making him collapse to the ground dead and then beheaded him. The victory made David famous among the Jews. 

Introduzione del David di Michelangelo 
David is a sculpture of enormous dimensions: 5.17 m, 1.07 base and 4.10 m the statue, today it is located in the gallery of the Academy in Florence.
Michelangelo's David is a sculpture that has fascinated the world for centuries, even before it was completed. Considered one of the most important masterpieces in the history of art, the marble sculpture shows the perfection of the artist's skill and represents the definition of art itself in the Renaissance. Since it was built it immediately became of great importance. Giorgio Vasari, artist, writer and historian, spoke of it as: "Veramente che questa opera ha tolto il grido a tutte le statue moderne et antiche, o greche o latine che elle si fossero"

Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, a key artist of the Italian Renaissance, created the statue from a single block of marble, between 1501 and 1504. He was only 26 when he began the sculpture, and when he finished it, just 29. The work was commissioned to Michelangelo from “I consoli dell’arte della lana” and the “Workers of the Florence Cathedral”.
He was given a 5.50 meter block of marble, known as the Giant after 1460 Agostino di Duccio and Antonio Rossellino tried to use it without success. In fact, the marble had numerous imperfections, called "taroli", tiny holes that compromise the mechanical qualities of resistance to chiseling but more generally make it fragile, which jeopardized the stability of the sculpture itself. Michelangelo filled the holes and made the surface of the stone perfectly smooth, demonstrating that he was able to sculpt David despite the imperfections. Already during the work there were numerous people  who tried to look at the courtyard of the current Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, and the sculptor had a fence built to protect themselves from the  eyes. In 1503, one year from the end, the statue was finally shown to the Florentines

Collocazione 
The sculpture is so big because it was meant to be placed high up on the cathedral, 40 feet above street level. For decades it had laid beside the Cathedral, but in the early years of the 1500s, the government of Florence decided to look back 100 years to what had been considered the Golden Age
of the Florentine Republic, and commission sculptures once again for the Cathedral. A lot had happened in those intervening years. Florence was a Republic, but one family in particular, the Medici, a banking family, took more and more control over the course of the 15th century until they were really sole rulers of the city, but still under the guise of the Republic. Late in the 15th century, they were run out of town. And a Republic was reestablished, but this happened right at the time of the ascendancy of a very charismatic monk named Savonarola, who essentially began to turn the newly reconstituted Republic of Florence into a theocratic state. Savonarola believed that Florence had gone astray in part because of its wealth, and an expression of that wealth was it's interest in humanism, its interest in the arts, and he's probably most famous for the Bonfire of the Vanities. That is his effort to rid the city of what he saw as the corruption of wealth, burning manuscripts, burning paintings.
But Savonarola's rule of Florence does not continue. He's excommunicated by the Pope, put under arrest and ultimately he's executed, and then his body is burned. The Florentine government defeats two tyrants. They defeat first, the Medici, and then Savonarola. And so it's critical to see the sculpture of David
against that background, especially because the biblical figure of David
meant something very special to the Florentine people.
When the Florentine people finally saw David, it was clear that it was too fabulous to place high up on the Cathedral, and so a new location had to be found for it. Ultimately it was decided to place the sculpture on a platform in front of the seat of government in Florence. Taking it from its original religious context and placing it into a political context. This sculpture became a symbol of the newly reconstituted Republic of Florence. Florence had run the Medici out. Florence had gotten rid of Savonarola, and was trying to re-establish itself as a Republic.The sculpture was so clearly now a symbol of the Florentine Republic, that stones were thrown at the sculpture by some people who were loyal to the Medici. So we're really looking at a very potent political symbol in addition to an almost super human achievement. It's no wonder that Michelangelo got the nickname il divino, the divine one. But it's so interesting because the people who flock to see the sculpture today are coming to see a work of art. This is a sculpture that was commissioned for a church for a religious context. Its meaning was transformed into an almost purely political one, and it's been transformed again in the context of our secular museum culture, into a work of art that can be understood as an expression of our history, our aesthetic appreciation, and perhaps most of all Michelangelo's mastery.

Contrasto Davide di Donatello 

Donatello made his famous David sculpture in 1440, some 60 years before Michelangelo, who created his own version in 1501-04. This means both artists were working during different political and cultural climates, which inevitably influenced the nature of their art. Donatello’s early Renaissance David was remarkable for the time because it was the first unsupported bronze cast of the Renaissance, and the first freestanding male nude that had been made since antiquity. It demonstrated the rising power of the Florentine Republic, which likened itself to the Roman Empire. Meanwhile, Michelangelo’s David is a high Renaissance masterpiece, demonstrating the true spirit of its time when greater awareness of science and human anatomy was taking hold.

The clients of the two works are different, one is the De Medici family for the royal palace, while Michelangelo has a religious client who commissions him to sculpt the work for the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. Donatello's was a teenager who rested his free left leg on the head of the giant, the body is without muscles. 
It is the opposite of what Michelangelo does, who emphasizes the physical appearance and masculinity of the subject, this can be seen from the tense musculature and the veins in relief that make the subject ready for action.
Furthermore, another relevant difference is the fact that Donatello describes the moment following the victory of the young man and the beheading of the giant, which can be seen from the severed head located under the foot of David; Michelangelo on the contrary describes what happens before the fight. The face of David represented by Donatello is pensive but also proud of the finished work, the head is slightly turned to the left and the gaze is down to observe the head of Goliath, while in the other work the head is turned in the direction of the giant and the forehead is slightly contracted, which indicates concentration
In both works the chiasmus is present, the contrast between the parts of the body that perform actions (in this case the left arm and the right leg that supports the weight) and those that do not.

Tomba di Giulio II

The Tomb of Julius II is a sculptural complex created by Michelangelo and located in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which according to the first plans should have consisted of about forty statues.
Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo in 1505 to build his tomb but due to many delays they ended in 1544. He started the project when he was 30 and finished it all when he was 70. There were a lot of projects and as Michelangelo created new ones, more and more elements were eliminated.
Michelangelo carried out six different projects for the construction of the monument and built the least complex one, given the scarce economic availability of Pope Julius II, who had also commissioned him to build the Sistine Chapel.
For the realization of the sculptures he personally chose the Marbles going to Carrara; for this choice it took him eight months.

Structured on two levels, the tomb has, on the lower sides, the figures of Leah and Rachel, and in the center Moses, which corresponds, on the second level, to the semi-reclining figure of the pontiff surmounted by the Virgin and Child.
The most famous statue of these is that of Moses, which was initially to be placed on the second level and also surrounded by other statues, but was eventually placed in the center of the lower register.
II Moses is depicted with the tables of the law (the ten commandments) under his right arm, received while he was on Mount Sinai; he is turned to the left to listen to God (not depicted) who speaks to him; Moses has two rays of sun on his head (they look like two horns, but they aren't), which followed him during his descent from Mount Sinai.
Moses is found seated and his beard initially falls in the way
straight and then crooked, and together with the legs, gives a sense of movement/rotation.
Near the Moses there must have been two Slaves; the Rebel one and that
Dying.
They are made with the "Unfinished" technique, since for
Michelangelo counted on the spirituality and not the perfection of the subjects he created, especially in his last period of life.
The Dying Slave is depicted during his last sigh of life, as he gets rid of a shirt. For some critics this sculpture is ambiguous: the slave seems to have no male characteristics.
 In spring, sunlight passes through a window of the basilica illuminating one statue at a time, an almost theatrical light.
