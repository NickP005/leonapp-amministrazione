Pro speech - The avengers should sign the Sovokia Accords

Honorable judges, I'm Niccolo Pagano and I'm the first speaker of the proposition team.
Luigi Minella is the secondth speaker and Carolina Menin in the third one.
I will be going to set the definitions of each term, then I will set out the arguments in favour of the team and then I will go to the first argument.
Firstly, "The Avengers." The Avengers are a group of superheroes, each with their unique set of abilities, who work together to protect the world from dangerous threats. They have saved the world multiple times, and their actions have always been under the radar of any governing bodies.
Secondly, "should sign." This implies that there is a choice to be made, and it is up to the Avengers to decide whether or not to sign the Sokovia Accords. Signing the agreement would mean agreeing to follow the rules and regulations set out in the document.
Finally, the "Sokovia Accords." The Sokovia Accords were introduced by the United Nations in response to the destruction caused by the Avengers during their battle with Ultron in Sokovia. The agreement requires the Avengers to operate under the jurisdiction of the United Nations and abide by the laws set out in the document.

I will be going to argument the first value which is safety. Luigi Minella will be going to argument the secondth value which is authority. Finally, Carolina Menin will counter argument the adversary team speach and will give examples that support our teamline.

Safety is the first value that we want to argue. 
The safety of the people is the highest priority, and it is the reason why we need to support the proposition that the Avengers should sign the Sokovia Accords. The Avengers have saved the world from several threats, but their actions have caused collateral damage, as seen in Sokovia, where innocent lives were lost. Signing the Sokovia Accords would ensure that the Avengers operate under a regulatory framework that guarantees the safety of the people.
Ensuring safety is a fundamental value that should be prioritized in any decision-making process, especially when it comes to the actions of powerful organizations like the Avengers. The Sokovia Accords provide a regulatory framework that guarantees the safety of people and minimizes collateral damage caused by the actions of the Avengers. For instance, during the Battle of New York, the Avengers' fight against the Chitauri caused significant destruction and loss of life. Similarly, the fight against Ultron in Sokovia resulted in the destruction of an entire city and countless civilian casualties. These incidents highlight the need for the Avengers to operate under a regulatory framework that ensures the safety of people while also allowing them to carry out their duties. By signing the Sokovia Accords, the Avengers can better coordinate with government agencies, access better resources, and be held accountable for their actions. This would ultimately enhance the safety of people and ensure that the Avengers can continue to protect the world without causing unnecessary harm.

We cannot let the Avengers operate without any regulatory framework and, for instance, anyone that has the power to cause any damage. Even if the Avengers are good people, they are still human beings and they can make mistakes. And when they make mistakes, they are very big mistakes. Thus having an agreement that can limit their power is a good thing because the
